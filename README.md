# Professional-Portfolio
Challenge Week 2

# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Professional-Portfolio is a website designed by myself to show off my best coding projects, so that I can display them for potential employers to see as I complete them. The website itself will be another way to show off my coding skills and what I learned so far using HTML and CSS. It needs to be interactive, organized, and meet accessibility standards so that it is readable on any device.  

My job is to create the CSS and HTML of my portfolio website so that: 

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

By accomplishing these goals, my website will serve as an ideal and impressive center where I can demonstrate my coding abilities. 

<!-- 
Before the edits were done, there were a lot of div elements that made the code unclear, and a lot of repetitive styles being used in CSS. Furthermore, one of the links in the navigation page was broken, and there were no alt descriptions for the images. 

Through the project, I applied the lessons learned in module 1 on the importance of semantic elements within HTML. I figured out how to use classes in a way that minimizes the amount of code typed within CSS. I also reorganized elements so that they proceeded in a logical way that complimented the HTML layout without compromising any of the visual elements already in place. I also made extensive use of the comment system to tell the reader what changes I made, as well as to show where one section ends and another begins. The distinction between the two comment types can be seen through the use of All Caps. 

Now, the website works even better than it used to, and can serve more easily as a template or something to grow from in the future.  -->

## Usage

The mock-up, whose look should not and did not differ from the final product, is shown below

![mock-up](/assets/images/mock-up.png)

You can use the new, clean code as a template in case a new page needs to be added to the website, or as an example to show new coders what good code looks like. An example of the edited code is below. Note the alternate text, the comments, and the semantic HTML elements.

## Credits

No classmates or instructors were used in the making of this website. The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The WHEN/THEN section of this README was taken directly from the homework assignment Acceptance Criteria. The Run-Buddy project of Modules 1 and 2 were used as an example to emulate as I organized Horiseon's website.  The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/), as suggested by the README Guide aforementioned.
