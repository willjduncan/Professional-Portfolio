# Professional-Portfolio
Challenge Week 2

## Description

Professional-Portfolio is a website designed by myself to show off my best coding projects, so that I can display them for potential employers to see as I complete them. The website itself will be another way to show off my coding skills and what I learned so far using HTML and CSS. It needs to be interactive, organized, and meet accessibility standards so that it is readable on any device.  

My job is to create the CSS and HTML of my portfolio website so that: 

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

By accomplishing these goals, my website will serve as an ideal and impressive center where I can demonstrate my coding abilities. 

First, I created the HTML section by section, in a similar style that RunBuddy was set up, beginning with the header and footer, followed by the hero, and then on to the Contact Me, Resume, and Work sections. These sections were chosen based on the mock-up video, as were the different work projects. Since Run Buddy is the only project completed so far, that was the only one I linked correctly. The projects link to tangentially related websites to serve as current placeholders.  

Once I had those HTML elements in place, I added CSS. Using a color code complimenter and generator found at https://coolors.co/, I arranged the styles to look good first as viewed from my own laptop. Once that was complete, I used Chrome DevTools to make changes and then tinker with the style at different sizes. Although Run Buddy was arranged for only 4 sizes (laptop, 980px, 768px, 570px), I also included an extra case for screen sizes below 400px, because things got wonky viewing it from common devices like the iPhone X. 

Now, the website is ready to be viewed and to have new projects added to it whenever I complete them. 


## Installation

My repository on GitHub is named Professional-Portfolio. The link to this repository is below.

## Usage

Screenshots are shown of the Professional Portfolio at the screen dimensions of 375px, 568px, 768px, and 812px respectively, to show how Chrome DevTools was used to help make sure the webpage is user-friendly and mobile-accessible.

## Credits

No classmates or instructors were used in the making of this website. The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The WHEN/THEN section of this README was taken directly from the homework assignment Acceptance Criteria. The Run-Buddy project of Modules 1 and 2 were used as an example to emulate as I organized Horiseon's website.  The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/), as suggested by the README Guide aforementioned. The color choices were made with the help of [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/).
